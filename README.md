Basic CV application created in React. Accepts personal details, professional experience and education.

To make this app practical for job applications, I will need to add at least:
- an extra input under "Personal Details" for a website/github link
- a Summary Component where applicant can describe himself in a few rows
- extra description fields for work experience
- a key skills / certificates component
